Interesting data columns for feature engineering

1.MSSubClass may need grouping into a smaller number of categories (convert to categorical)

2.LotFrontage: has missing values that need to be imputed --done

3.Alley: NA should be replaced by a string that says 'None' because it means there is no alley access --done

4.Neighborhood: might need grouping

5.OverallQual: scale should be categorical

6.OverallCond: scale should be categorical

7.YearBuilt: should be categorical. Might need grouping according to range.

8.YearRemodAdd: can be used to create another feature column Remod, which should be 1/0 binary according to the rule YearBuilt==YearRemodAdd then 0 else 1

9.Exterior1st: might need grouping

10.Exterior2nd: might need grouping

Note: both 9 and 10 can be merged together? 

11.MasVnrType: has a few NA that need imputing

12.MasVnrArea: has a few NA that need imputing. What is the area for None ? 0?

13.BsmtQual: NA should be replaced with None. Is there a string 'NA' or a np.null ?

14.BsmtCond: same as 13

15.BsmtExposure: same as 13

16.BsmtFinType1: same as 13

17.BsmtFinSF1: should have 0 corresponding to NA in 16

18.BsmtFinType2: could be used with 16 to create another feature, binary 0/1, BsmtMult, which indicates if there are multiple finished spaces in the basement (1) or not (0)

19.BsmtFinSF2: same as 17

20.BsmtFullBath: should be categorical ? Might need grouping ?

21.BsmtHalfBath: same as 20

22.FullBath: same as 20. 

23.HalfBath: same as 20

24.Bedroom: same as 20

25.Kitchen: same as 20

26.TotRmsAbvGrd: same as 20

27.Fireplaces: same as 20

28.FireplaceQu: check that NA corresponds to 0 in 27. Replace NA by 'None'

29.GarageType: NA to 'None'

30.GarageYrBlt: convert too categorical. Possibly needs grouping. Replace NA with 'None'

31.GarageFinish: same as 29

32.GarageCars: check that 0 corresponds to NA in 29, 30, 31

33.GarageArea: same as 32

34.GarageQual: same as 29

35.GarageCond: same as 29

36.PoolQC: same as 29

37.PoolArea: check that 0 corresponds to NA in 36

38.Fence: same as 29. Mostly NA so may be convert to binary 1/0

39.MiscFeature: same as 38

40.MiscVal: will be mostly 0, should correspond to NA in 39

41.MoSold: should be categorical.

42.YrSold: should be categorical? Probably needs grouping

43.SaleType: might need grouping

44.SaleCondition: same as 43
